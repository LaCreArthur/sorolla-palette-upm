# Sample Scene

The sample scene `PrototypeTestScene.unity` should be created in Unity:

1. Create a new scene in Unity
2. Go to **Sorolla > Create Prototype Test UI**
3. Add a Camera and Light if not present
4. Save the scene as `PrototypeTestScene.unity` in this folder

## Alternative

You can also use the menu item in any existing scene to create the test UI on demand.
